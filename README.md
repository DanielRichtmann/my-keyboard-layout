# my-keyboard-layout

This repository holds the keyboard layout I prefer to use which is based on
neo-2.

## Modifications to neo-2

* Instead of the compose key (unneeded in my daily use) ```Mod3+Tab``` is mapped
  to ```Esc``` for easy use with vim
* Left and Right ```Windows``` keys are additional ```CTRL``` since I noticed
  that the stretching when pressing normal ```CTRL``` hurt my hands

## Installation

``` shell
    xmodmap <file>
```
